TOXIC
I think I'm ready now
I think I'm ready now
Instrumental

Baby, can't you see
I'm calling
A guy like you should wear a warning
It's dangerous
I'm falling
INSTRUMENTAL

There's no escape
I can't wait
I need a hit
Baby, give me it
You're dangerous
I'm loving it


Too high
Can't come down
Losin' my head
Spinnin' 'round and 'round
Do you feel me now?

With the taste of your lips
I'm on a ride
You're toxic I'm slippin' under (Ohh)
With a taste of the poison paradise
I'm addicted to you
Don't you know that you're toxic?
And I love what you do
Don't you know that you're toxic?

It's getting late
To give you up
I took a sip
From my devil's cup
Slowly, it's taking over me

Too high
Can't come down
It's in the air and it's all around
Can you feel me now?


With the taste of your lips
I'm on a ride
You're toxic I'm slippin' under
With the taste of the poison paradise
I'm addicted to you
Don't you know that you're toxic?

And I love what you do
Don't you know that you're toxic?

Don't you know that you're toxic?

Taste of your lips I'm on a ride
You're toxic I'm slippin' under
With a the taste of a poison paradise
I'm addicted to you
Don't you know that you're toxic?

With the taste of your lips
I'm on a ride
You're toxic I'm slippin' under (Toxic)
With the taste of the poison paradise
I'm addicted to you
Don't you know that you're toxic?

Intoxicate me now
With your lovin' now
I think I'm ready now
(I think I'm ready now)
Intoxicate me now
With your lovin' now
I think I'm ready now

EVERYTIME SONGTEXT
Notice me, take my hand
Why are we strangers when
Our love is strong
Why carry on without me

Our love was strong
Why carry on without me?

Everytime I try to fly I fall
Without my wings, I feel so small
I guess I need you baby
And everytime I see you in my dreams
I see your face, it′s haunting me
I guess I need you baby

I make believe
That you are here
It's the only way
I see clear

What have I done?
You seem to move on easy...


And everytime I try to fly, I fall
Without my wings, I feel so small
I guess I need you baby
And everytime I see you in my dreams
I see your face, you′re haunting me
I guess I need you baby

I may have made it rain, babe
Please forgive me
But my weakness caused you pain
And this songs my sorry

Oohh

At night I pray
That soon your face will fade away

And everytime I try to fly, I fall
Without my wings, I feel so small
I guess I need you baby
And everytime I see you in my dreams
I see your face, you're haunting me
I guess I need you baby

And everytime I try to fly, I fall
Without my wings, I feel so small
I guess I need you baby
And everytime I see you in my dreams
I see your face, it's haunting me
I guess I need you baby

Boy you′ve got me blinded
Oh pretty baby, there′s nothing that I wouldn't do
It′s not the way I planned it

You can play brand new to all the other chicks out here
But I know what you are, what you are, baby

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I think I did it again
I made you believe we′re more than just friends
Oh, baby, it might seem like a crush
But it doesn't mean that I′m serious

'Cause to lose all my senses
That is just so typically me
Oh, baby, baby

Oops, I did it again
I played with your heart
Got lost in the game
Oh, baby, baby
Oops, you think I'm in love
That I′m sent from above
I′m not that innocent


You see, my problem is this
I'm dreaming away, wishing that heroes, they truly exist
I cry watching the days
Can′t you see I'm a fool in so many ways?

But to lose all my senses
That is just so typically me
Oh, baby, oh

Oops, I did it again
I played with your heart
Got lost in the game
Oh, baby, baby
Oops, you think I′m in love
That I'm sent from above
I′m not that innocent

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

All aboard
Britney, before you go, there's something I want you to have
Oh, it's beautiful, but wait a minute, isn′t this?
Yeah, yes, it is
But I thought the old lady dropped it into the ocean in the end
Well, baby, I went down and got it for ya
Aw, you shouldn′t have


Oops, I did it again to your heart
Got lost in this game, oh, baby
Oops, you (oops, you) think that I'm sent from above
I′m not that innocent

CIRCUS

There′s only two types of people in the world:
The ones that entertain, and the ones that observe
Well, baby, I'm a put on-a-show kind of girl
Don′t like the back seat, gotta be first

I'm like the ring leader, I call the shots
(Call the shots)
I'm like a firecracker I make it hot
When I put on a show

I feel the adrenaline moving through my veins
Spotlight on me and I′m ready to break
I′m like a performer, the dance floor is my stage
Better be ready, hope that you feel the same

All eyes on me in the center of the ring just like a circus
When I crack that whip everybody gon' trip just like a circus
Don′t stand there watching me, follow me, show me what you can do
Everybody let go, we can make a dance floor just like a circus


There's only two types of guys out there
Ones that can hang with me and ones that are scared
So, baby, I hope that you came prepared
I run a tight ship so beware

I′m like the ring leader, I call the shots
(Call the shots)
I'm like a firecracker I make it hot
When I put on a show

I feel the adrenaline moving through my veins
Spotlight on me and I′m ready to break
I'm like a performer, the dance floor is my stage
Better be ready, hope that you feel the same

All eyes on me in the center of the ring just like a circus
When I crack that whip everybody gon' trip just like a circus
Don′t stand there watching me, follow me, show me what you can do
Everybody let go, we can make a dance floor just like a circus

Is she in the bathroom? Is she smoking up outside?
Oh, baby, baby, does she take a piece of lime
For the drink that I′mma buy her
Do you know just what she likes?

Oh

'Cause I′m so, oh, I can't get her off of my brain
I just wanna go to the party she gonna go

Love me, hate me

Amy told me that she′s gonna meet me up
I don′t know where or when and now they're closing up the club
I′ve seen her once or twice before; she knows my face
But it's hard to see with all the people standing in the way

Oh, oh, tell me have you seen her
′Cause I'm so, oh, I can′t get her off of my brain
I just wanna go to the party she gonna go
Can somebody take me home?
